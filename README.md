# Inital-Test-Repo
Hello Dear User,

This is a standard repo added when an account for a new user is created. You can delete this repo at any time in the menu in the top right corner. In this corner you can also add your public and private repos.

Here are a couple of short instructions on how this application works.

1. You can link any text (code is also text) in the app with any other text in any repo you choose in the app.
2. In order to create a link you tag part of the text on the one side of the screen and then tag part of the text on the other side of the screen - then a pop-up will come up with the LINK button. You can link from left to right or the other way round.
3. You can create multiple links to the same part of text.
4. When someone changes your source file on repository code or docs that had a link on them, you will get notification on your email about that. When you click on the link and login to the app you will see in the right top corner a notification icon with a list of all notifications.
5. When you click on one of the notifications you will see: on the right what has changed in the code or in docs and an old link before the change was made (in yellow). On the left you will see the other side of this link, so that you know which part of documentation (or the code) should be reviewed in the context of the changes on the right.
6. The last thing that you should do is to update the link on the right by tagging text in the same way as in the main view. After you tag a text and UPDATE LINK button will pop-up. Now the link is up-to-date. And you can click on the Quit button and go to the next notification.

Here is a short video tutorial of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMrzU2nnv1M
